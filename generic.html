								<h2>Football</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Football.JPG" alt="" /></span>
									<br> I'm a devoted football fan. I regularly watch and play the sport for its intensity and for the love of the sports itself. I regularly participate in intra-college
									competitions and local tournaments to keep myself fit. Most recently, in my under graduate degree, I participated and won an intra-college tournament, where 
									I played a crucial role in the success as the cornerstone of our team's defense. The sport has taught me <b> cooperation and coordination when working in dynamic 
									teams, the importance of strategy and most importantly to never give up. </b>

								<h2>Public Speaking</h2>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Debate.JPG" alt="" /></span> I actively engage in public speaking, participating in events like debates, presentations, 
									discussions and elocutions every chance I get, in both my academic work and in competetive settings. These experiences have helped me improve my<b> confidence, clarity of 
									thought and my ability to communicate ideas clearly</b>. It also helped me in shaping and improving my inter-personal skills and my language proficiency.

								<h2>Creative Writing</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<br> 
									My journey into creative writing began with small competitions that pushed me to craft and process ideas in imaginative and descriptive ways. I recently participated
									in story writing and essay writing competetions in an intra-collegiate where I secured second and third place respectively.  These competitions over time, <b>sharpened my 
									ability to generate compelling narratives and convey messages effectively. </b>
